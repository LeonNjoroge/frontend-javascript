# TypeScript Fundamentals Project

## 📘 Project Description

This project is designed to build a strong foundation in **TypeScript** by exploring core concepts such as types, interfaces, classes, functions, and advanced features like generics and namespaces. It emphasizes practical usage by integrating TypeScript with the DOM and external libraries. By the end of this project, you will understand how to write type-safe and scalable TypeScript code for modern web development.
